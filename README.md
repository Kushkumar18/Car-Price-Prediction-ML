# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🚗💰

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the price of a used car based on features like brand, year, mileage, and fuel type. The model was trained using **linear regression**, achieving an **R² score of 0.89**.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains information such as:  
- **Car Name**  
- **Company**  
- **Year of Manufacture**  
- **Kilometers Driven**  
- **Fuel Type**  
- **Price** (Target Variable)  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **pandas, numpy** (Data Processing)  
- **scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** (Visualization)  

## 📈 Model Performance  
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression  
- **R² Score:** 0.89  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score  

## 💡 Future Improvements  
✅ Use advanced models like **Random Forest, Neural Networks** for better accuracy.  
✅ Deploy the model as a **web application** for real-time predictions.
